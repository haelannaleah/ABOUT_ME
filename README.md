# ABOUT_ME
A formal resume is included, but for now...

Hi! I'm Annaleah. I'm studying electrical engineering as a junior at Harvard University in Cambridge. I love computer science, electronics, taekwondo, speaking Mandarin, singing, learning, and making interesting things. I interned for NASA through the National Science Foundation's REU program this summer as a heliophysics student researcher. In the fall, I'll be starting my new job as a teaching fellow at Harvard's CS50.

I was a United States Presidential Scholar in 2013, and honored by the Alaska State Legislature in 2014.

I'm still getting used to the world of science and people (Alaska's a little light on the technology and population density), and I must say, the world we live in today is pretty amazing. The more I learn about the way things work, the more astounding I find it that they exist.
